# A-Two-Step-Disentanglement-Method
Model implementation and trained network for "A Two-Step Disentanglement Method" by Naama Hadad, Lior Wolf and Moni Shahar from Tel Aviv University.
This work address the problem of disentanglement of factors that generate a given data into those that are correlated with the labeling and those that are not. The model employs adversarial training in a straightforward manner.
The code was developed on Ubuntu , using Theano+Keras.
